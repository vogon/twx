========
- pic.twitter.com PNG munging
	- does it strip out text sections?
		+ it does (per experiments w/ png-text-sizetest.rb)
		- if not, jam everything into a text section (boring)
	- does it ever re-encode PNGs to JPEG?  when?
		- if not, pack everything into PNG image data
		- if so, pack everything into JPEG image data
	- does it ever re-encode JPEGs at a lower q level?  when?
		- if not, choose q=1.00 and a lazy ARGB encoding
		- if so, research encodings that are robust to JPEG processing

video
=====
- using a non-official vine client: this, like, hella violates TOS, right?
- how much entropy can we store in the video information of MPEG 4?
- how much entropy can we store in the audio information of MPEG 4?

media-agnostic

- write a multi-part unpacker
- write a spec for porting's sake
